# Basic-level Components
Components in this folder should:

- Be stateless

- Be reusable across the application

- Focus solely on rendering UI, with no module-specific functionality

- Be globally available to other modules

- Remain as simple and minimal as possible

These components serve as building blocks, used to compose more complex components within each moduleâ€™s components folder.
